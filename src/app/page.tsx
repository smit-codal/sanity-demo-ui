              Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the
              utility-first classNamees from Tailwind CSS. It also includes
              interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.

              Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some
              ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through
              before committing to an actual design project.

                component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite

              . It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as
              buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are
              conveniently built with the utility classNamees from Tailwind CSS.

              Getting started with Flowbite
            </h2>
            <p>
              First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This
              library is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of
              components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from
              the documentation.
